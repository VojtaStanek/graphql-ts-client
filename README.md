'graphql-ts-client' is a graphql client for TypeScript, it has two functionalities:

1. Supports GraphQL queries with strongly typed code.
2. **Automatically infers the type of the returned data according to the strongly typed query request**, This is the essential difference between this framework and other similar frameworks, and it is also the reason why I created it.
